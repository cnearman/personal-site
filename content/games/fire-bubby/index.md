Play Fire Bubby online [here](https://cnearman.itch.io/fire-bubby)!

In Fire Bubby, you deploy a team of yokai-like creatures to save a town that is burning down.
Players recruit different bubby to try and receive recompense for saving the buildings and
townspeople. Play is influenced heavily by auto-battler style games, allowing players to deploy
units which the player has no direct control over to accomplish a task. Psychologically, we
employed the usage of strict time limits during the setup and play phases to support this "out
of control" feeling.

Fire Bubby was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2020.
