Play Little Guys [here](https://cnearman.itch.io/littleguys)!

In Little Guys, you take the role of two Little Guys trainers in the heat of battle. Little guys can
win in battle by either absorbing more of the blue healing energy, or by knocking out the other
team. Each Little Guy has their own style, so try to build a team that can win any fight!

The Little Guys is a multiplayer game, where combat is based on capturing points which also
heal any of your little guys that are currently out. If you have any capture points saved, they will
be consumed to heal those guys. This push and pull can cause players to switch their
techniques mid-battle to become more focused on defending the capture point with one of
their displacement effects, or if necessary, completely ignore the capture point and try to get a
cheeky stun combo. 

Little Guys was made for the GMTK Game Jam 2017.
