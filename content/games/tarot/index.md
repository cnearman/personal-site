Tarot is a first-person shooter where the player uses their deck of tarot cards to battle their
enemies. And friends. The game contains a short campaign and
split-screen multiplayer where players fight one another with the insane abilities contained in
their deck.

Tarot was created for Ludum Dare 29.
